# Python-multi-encryption
This code is to test if its possible to encrypt
files multiply times using python lib cryptography

The plan is to make a program to make a file or
files impossible to decrypt without another
program to decrypt them making the data 100% secure
so that the owner of the data has peace of mind
Knowing their data is 100% secure

Changes made:
•encryption script tested and added to repo
Test was successful
•decryption script tested and added to repo
Test was successful, small issue with the script
attempting to decrypt with the wrong key error 
on my part no issue with code
