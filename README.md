# Python-multi-encryption
This code is to test if its possible to encrypt
files multiply times using python lib cryptography

The plan is to make a program to make a file or
files impossible to decrypt without another
program to decrypt them making the data 100% secure
so that the owner of the data has peace of mind
Knowing their data is 100% secure
